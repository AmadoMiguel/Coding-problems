# Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral!
# You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its '
# content.
#
# The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the following
# way: Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3
# square that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.
#
# Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
