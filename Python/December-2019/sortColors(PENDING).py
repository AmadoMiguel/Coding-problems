# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are
# adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
#
# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
#
# Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem.
#
# Can you do this in a single pass?
#
# Example:
# Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
# Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
